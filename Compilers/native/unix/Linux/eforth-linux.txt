--- Linux/i386 port of eForth v1.0 - UnRelease e ---

   Linux Specificities:
* now uses elf-i386 object file format.
  Old a.out still present but untested.
* eForth boot message is disabled, use word ' hi to print it.
* eForth reads from stdin, not manually echoing input
  (under Linux, by default, the terminal traditionally does the echoing).
* CR actually outputs a linefeed character, not a CRLF sequence
* words argc, argv, and environ are defined to have grant access to
  parameter data structures...
* Unless you undefine __SYSCALL__ in the sources, words syscall0 - syscall5
  are defined which do Linux system calls. Could be used as a basis to a
  library to access system resources; linking with C could be done instead,
  but then, you should get gforth, so that's not the goal.
* Just for fun, I added TOS (top of stack) buffering in %ebx, and replaced
  NEXT by an ENTER/NEXT pair (both can be disabled).
* added some support for debugging (disabled as I only release working stuff :)
* please do send me (fare@tunes.org) any improvement.

   The best docs is the source.

   Have fun hacking eForth !!!

In a five year period we can get one superb programming language.
Only we can't control when the five year period will begin. -- Alan Perlis
