<[Frank] FIGGUEST> Today, I wrote Pygmy Forth for 3 reasons:
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>      1. I was unhappy with certain aspects
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>         of L&P's F83:
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>           a. The slow & awkward editor
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>           b. The size & complexity
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>              (then what must I think of F-PC?)
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>      2. Certain ideas from cmFORTH appealed to
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>         me very strongly:
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>           a. PUSH POP (instead of >R R>)
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>           b. FOR NEXT
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>           c. no IMMEDIATE word
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>              (but it does have immediate words)
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>           d. simple Meta-Compilation
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>      3. I wanted my Forth to be under my
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>         complete control.
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> Tomorrow, I may have written it for other reasons.
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> Clarifications:
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>      1. 'Pygmy' is short for 'Pygmy Forth'.  It is NOT
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>          a new language.  It is Forth (as I see it) all
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>          the way.
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>      2. Pygmy is NOT Public Domain.  It is shareware.
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>         The fee is reasonable hjzUJ
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>         The fee is reasonable (from a minimum of ZERO to
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>         a maximum of all you have - your choice).
<[Frank] FIGGUEST>      3. Is Pygmy perfect?  Of course not.
<R.Berkey> is here
<[jax4figboard] JAX> Frank, reading back over your "checkered career" :-) ...
<[jax4figboard] JAX> makes me think of Zimmer and the "Forth of the MOnth Club" 
...
<[jax4figboard] JAX> to what extent do you feel you share an approach to Forth 
with TZ?
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> I think our philosophies are quite different ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> but we both seem to be willing to do a lot of work ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> on our Forths.  His is a massive project and mine is much ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> smaller.  I think a Forth should be small ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> Wil's recent postings said a lot that I feel about it.
<[Wil] W.BADEN1> I like your concept so much, I have put Ed Forth on a back 
burner.  Pygmy may be the better way to go.  I have one reservation -- it'
s not classical Forth.  
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> In what way ? 
<[Wil] W.BADEN1> Classical Forth does not have the things you like most about 
cmForth.
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> Yes, ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> I see your point.  My feeling is that Pygmy is fairly true 
to the ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> deeper, underlying spirit of Forth. ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> I but it has certain differences from what we have been used 
to.  ga
<[Wil] W.BADEN1> I think that cmForth and Pygmy may be better than classical 
Forth, but Chuck is 18 years too late. (All verbs regular in English would
be an impprovement.)
<[Doug] D.PHILIPS3> I have a few questions ...
<[Doug] D.PHILIPS3> so answer as many is appropriate or that you think are 
interesting...
<[Doug] D.PHILIPS3> a)  If you register for Pygmy do you get any printed 
material?
<[Doug] D.PHILIPS3> b)  Do you have a quick reference card?
<[Doug] D.PHILIPS3> c)  Do you like the current state of documentation?
<[Doug] D.PHILIPS3> d)  Do you do more *to* Pygmy than *with* it?
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> a: no ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> b: no
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> c: Yes & No ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> The documentation can always be clearer and I will almost ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> certainly make some improvements.  As I mentioned in the 
Pre-Pyg posting ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> I am interested in how to put someone smoothly into the 
driver's seat with ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> a new software pkg. ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> On the other hand, it is all there and accessible and of a 
size ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> that I think people can face without overwhelm.  I hope to 
do better though ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> d: yes & no ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> I really use Pygmy.  I have done some extensive financial 
calculations ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> bond & money-mkt type work for clients, pop-up menus, etc. 
and have ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> been pretty happy with it.  So, I have been using more for 
real work ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> lately than I have been working on it. ga
<JDHALL> is here.
<[Kent] K.PETERSON5> Frank, I came over to Pygmy from Zen and had no great 
culture shock...
<[Kent] K.PETERSON5> the for - next did take a bit of getting used to but now I 
prefer it...
<T.GUIMOND> is here.
<[Kent] K.PETERSON5> I see by the BBS postings that you've gone to a ?FOR which 
looks good...
<[Kent] K.PETERSON5> my question is, will we see a Pygmy 1.3 soon or should we 
patch our own systems?
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> Pygmy goes out into the ether and I don't know what happens 
to it.  I see numerous downloads of it ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> from GEnie.  I gather it is distri. by Compserve and one or .
..
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> more shareware houses, but I never hear any details. ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> Why change the water in the gold fish bowl when they haven't 
drunk ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> all I gave them last time? ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> So, hearing from people who either like or usePygmy or both .
..
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> (such as yourself) has really lifted my spirits and I do now 
plan on ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> releasing a v1.3.  My current "in house" version has some 
improvements ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> already - such as the editor knowing where the end of the 
file is ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> and search across screens not needing to be given an ending 
scr # ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> and HOLES to make opening up a file to add screens in the 
middle easy ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> In addition, I want to tend to as many of the "little" 
things as possible ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> which is one reason I want to hear the troubles everyone has 
had getting ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> started with it.
<[jax4figboard] JAX> Frank, speaking of "different than classical Forth", what 
do you think of ANS Forth proceedings and the BASIS? ga
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> ha ha ha ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> That's a favorite topic of mine at the moment ...
<[Frank] FIGGUEST> I think that the committee has an impossible job to do and ..
