*** WHAT THIS IS

Mops App (MA) is a set of Mops source code files that provide a basic framework
for a typical multi-window Macintosh application.

Also included is an updated Selection Framework (SF).  The SF works well with MA
because action handlers are almost never used so it is simple to instantiate
multiple objects.  Multiple window objects are needed when an application allows
the user to open more than one document at a time.


*** HOW TO USE MOPS APP 3.0

Note.  You must be using Mops 68K version 3.3 or later in order to use Mops App.
MA and SF do not yet work with Power Mops, but changing them to do so should
not be difficult and is planned for the near future.


1) Place the folder "Mops App 3.0" in the same directory as your "Mops 3.x" folder.
 Not *in* the "Mops 3.x" folder, but in the same directory, or folder.
 Add the following lines to your "Mops.paths" file (in your "Mops Ä" folder):

:::Mops App 3.0:
:::Mops App 3.0:SF 3.0:

2) Place the resource file "Mops App.rsrc" in your "Mops Ä" folder.

3) You should now be able to load the file "Example Application", which will also
load, via need, all of the necessary files to see how an example Mops App can
work.

4) You can now either execute 'go' to use Mops App during your
Mops development session or you can invoke Install... from the Mops menu to
create an installed application.  If you do an install, be sure to copy all
of the resources from the file "Mops App.rsrc" to the installed application
before running it.
