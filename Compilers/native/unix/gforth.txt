Gforth is a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth
language. It works nicely with the Emacs editor, offers some nice
features such as input completion and history and a powerful locals
facility, and it even has (the beginnings of) a manual. Gforth employs
traditional implementation techniques: its inner innerpreter is
indirect or direct threaded.  Gforth is distributed under the GNU
General Public license (see COPYING).

Gforth runs under Unix and DOS and should not be hard to port to other
systems supported by GCC. This version has been tested successfully on
Linux (for Intel), SunOS (SPARC) and Ultrix (MIPS).

Read INSTALL for installation instructions. Mail
gforth-bugs@mips.complang.tuwien.ac.at if you have problems.  To start
the system, just say `gforth' (after installing it).

You can find new versions of Gforth at

http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth
or
ftp://ftp.complang.tuwien.ac.at/pub/forth

This site will also contain binary distributions of Gforth for some
popular platforms when it has proved stable.

If you want to work on Gforth, mail me. Tasks to be done can be found
in ToDo; but if you would like to do something not mentioned there,
it's ok, too. In any case, we would like to hear what you are
doing. The most important tasks IMO are the missing ANS Forth words,
the documentation and the foreign language interface for C.
