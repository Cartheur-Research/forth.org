Readme file for HC16E4th.ASM


        68HC16 eForth is a direct threaded eforth meant to be
        assembled with the Motorola ToolWare M68HC16 Macro Assembler
        and used on the Motorola M68HC16EVB.

        The M68HC16EVB used for this example of eForth has additional
        RAM installed in sockets U1 and U3. The RAM in these sockets
        is both byte and word addressable in contrast to Pseudo ROM
        in sockets U2 and U4 which are wired for word reads/writes
        but only byte reads.

        Most of the words have been tested. There still may be a bug
        or two in this version of HC16E4TH.ASM, but it has been working.

        Add interrupts and DSP code and have fun.
