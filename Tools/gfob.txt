This program is an obfuscator for Forth source code. All comments
(including dot-banana printing comments) are removed, and all words
defined in the file are replaced with tokens consisting of ~ and some
characters, unless they are declared public, in which case they are passed
through unchanged.

The test code is a slightly modified version of the ISAAC random number
generator. This is provided as an example; if you want to actually use
ISAAC, get it from the Forth Scientific Library at
http://www.taygeta.com . The test routines are always compiled in this
version here; in the version in FSL they are conditionally compiled.

The source gets harder to read toward the end. After redefining the
comment words, I could no longer make comments.

The Makefile contains the following targets:
gfob	The default. Compiles the program.
install	Installs the program in /usr/local/bin , or if that fails, in
	~/bin .
test	Obfuscates isaac and checks that the original minus the PUBLIC
	statements and the obfuscated code output the same output.
clean	Removes files produced by compiling and testing.

This program requires Gforth.

This is a barely working version. If it doesn't work on your program, but
you can make it work, please send me the fixes.

Please send all improvements, comments, etc. to phma@trellis.net .
