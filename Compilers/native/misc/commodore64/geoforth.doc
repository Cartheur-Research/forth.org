This is Forth language for Geos.

A full documentation is included in the archived file. The documentation
is written on geoWrite format.

To dearchive geoforth.arc use ARC2.xx archiver.
When you dearchive, you will get two files: the program and the documentation.
Next, you need to use convert2.5 (a lower version with not work proper) to
convert the files to Geos type.
