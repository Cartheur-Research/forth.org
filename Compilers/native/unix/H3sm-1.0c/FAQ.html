For section 19, Forth that ain't necessarily Forth, non-commercial


o  H3sm, Hohensee's 3-stack machine, and cLIeNUX 
&lt <a href=http://linux01.gwdg.de/~rhohen/H3sm.html> H3sm</a>   &gt 
has a return stack, and a pointer stack with functionality that is a 
subset of the Forth parameter stack, combined with a data stack of 
bytes handled as groups of 1 to 256 bytes called "pytes". As of 19991222
H3sm has an interpreter but no interpretive threader, or "compiler".
It does do some rustic pyte arithmatic, so it does outline a 3-stack 
machine design. My (and currently the only) version is for IA32 Linux. 
Chances are good that there's more to it by the time you read this.

My cLIeNUX Linux/GNU/unix distribution is "Forth-influenced".

The old email in the FAQ works, but I almost never check it. This is
the live one...
