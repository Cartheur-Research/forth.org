Welcome to UNTIL, the UNconventional Threaded Interpretative Language. 
It is a Forth-like language written in C for extreme portability. 
Versions of Until run on at least four operating systems, compiled with
five different C compilers. Until has about 95% of the functionality of
a full Forth system; plus some features available in few if any other
Forth's. It was designed from the ground up to be embedded in other
programs and used as a 'macro' language. Both calling other C functions
and being called by other C functions is extremely easy with Until. 

This disk comprises the UNTIL Language Materials and is Copyrighted. 
See the file LICENSE.TXT or the documentation (DOC.LIS) for details. 
The distribution requirements are very liberal. 

Files included in this package are:

FILE           	DESCRIPTION
----            -----------
00READ.ME    	This file.
APPLIC.APP   	A simple default application file.
CALL.C       	The Compiler module source code.
COMPILE.COM	VMS command file to compile Until.
COMPILER.H   	Header file for selecting the compiler being used.
DOC.LIS      	Until Reference Manual in plain ASCII form.
FILEXAMP.APP 	The File Word example code from the Ref Manual.
FILTER.APP	A skeleton file filter program. It reads a file, and
		executes a user specified word on each line. When used
		with the search and replace words, FILTER provides a
		very convenient text filter.
FILTEREX.APP	A file filter example that floads FILTER.APP.
FUNCTS.H     	Function prototypes.
HELP.APP     	The help file used inside Until.
HELP.C       	Source for the help file module.
IO.C         	File IO module source code.
LICENSE.TXT  	Until License.
LINK.COM	VMS command file to link Until.
MAKEFILE	Unix makefile. Works with Sun Sparc ANS C, GCC on a Sparc,
		and Silicon Graphics ANS C. 
MATH.C       	Math module source code.
OUTER.C      	The Outer Interpreter source code.
PCOLON.APP   	Sample Until program to print all colon definitions
		in a source file.
PRIM.C       	Until primitive words source code.
SEAL.C       	Seal module source code.
SEARCH.C	An experimental module that contains simple, brute
		force search and replace code. Note that while this code
		has had good results from initial testing, it is not
		documented. Use the words defined in it at your own risk!
SPLITHTM.APP 	Sample Until program that splits up large HTML files.
STOIC.APP    	The Stoic String package.
STREXAMP.APP 	C String example from the documentation.
STRING.C     	String module source code.
UNTIL.APP    	Default, minimal startup code. It is sealed 
		into UNTIL.
UNTIL.BIN    	Sealed version of UNTIL.APP.
UNTIL.C      	Main program source code.
UNTIL.EXE    	Executable Until.
UNTIL.H      	Until data structures and global variables.
USER.C       	Primitive C words interfaced here.
VOCAB.C      	Vocabulary module source code.


The absolute minimum you need to run with is UNTIL.EXE. It's a good
idea to have an UNTIL.BIN for words you always use or for a
complete application if you distribute one. The file APPLIC.APP
is always loaded if it exists. This is a convenient place to put
code in development. Other source files may be specified on the
command line via the -f option:

	UNTIL -fpcolon.app

will run Until and compile pcolon.app. 

The default editor from within Until is EMACS. I use MicroEMACS
quite nicely. The editor name can be changed in UNTIL.H, then
recompile Until or rename your normal editor to EMACS.EXE.


DOCUMENTATION 
------------- 
A plain ASCII version of the Until Reference Manual is contained on this
disk. Typeset manual and electronic HTML document versions are
available. A minimal version of Until is also described in "Write Your
Own Programming Language Using C++", ISBN # 1-55622-264-5. Examples of
using Until as embedded macro languages can be found in "Programming
Output Drivers Using Borland C++", ISBN # 1-55622-309-9 and in "Getting
the Most From Your HP LaserJet Printer", scheduled to be published in
January 1995. The books are published by Wordware Publishing
(214-423-0090) and can be ordered from FIG or any bookstore. 

The ASCII manual has been revised. It is now up to date. A new section
on the string was added along with an updated word glossary. HELP.APP
has also been regenerated and includes all of the words in the glossary. 

A browsable HTML version of the Reference Manual with numerous
hyperlinks is available on the World Wide Web at
http://taygeta.oc.nps.navy.mil/until.html. A link to it is included on
the Forth Page on Taygeta. 


RELEASE NOTES
-------------
V2.2	Reworked UNTIL.C to make Until easier to embed and wrote
	instructions. Replaced help() with code contributed by Michael
	Mundrane. Modified get_stdin() to call fgets() instead of gets() and
	make EOF from the keyboard exit Until instead of generating an
	error per a suggestion by Michael Mundrane. Moved file 
	descriptor stack from UNTIL.H to IO.H. 

	Cleaned up code by removing unreferenced variables per
	suggestions by Akira Kida. This eleminates most of the warning
	messages generated while compiling Until. Akira also
	contributed a working version of shell() for Unix systems. 

	Corrected bug in SEAL.C. The code to leave blanks embedded
	blanks in ." and " had not been written previously. 

	Corrected coding errors in SEARCH.C. The string search and
	replace words are now functional. Michael Mundrane supplied
	me with a revised SEARCH.C as part of beta testing, which
	will probably be included in a future release. The words
	have also been included in the word glossary.

	Compiled Until under VAX/VMS. There are several compile errors
	that should be fixed. Until seems to run OK, but has not
	been extensively tested yet. The DCL command files to compile
	and link Until are now included in the distribution.


V2.1	There are one major enhancement in V2.1 and several lesser
	ones. The big one is that the port to 'Unix' is now done. The 
	supplied makefile works with Sun Sparc ANS C and SGI ANS C 
	unchanged. Simply change the 'cc' to 'gcc' and the makefile 
	works on GCC on the Sparc as well. Hopefully, it is generic 
	enough to work on any Unix system. Of course TC++ and BC++ 
	still compile Until via the project file. 

	I discovered that \ does not work properly with the new version 
	of word() from V2.0.4. I have reverted back to the original
	word() for the time being. 

	A new module, SEARCH.C, and associated words, sub and gsub, were
	added. I use AWK a fair amount at work to clean up HTML files
	during document conversion. About 90% of the AWK programs are
	searching for one string and replacing it with another. sub
	and gsub words are equivalent to the AWK functions of the same
	name. These along with FILTER.APP, which contains a skeleton
	file filter program, make writing these same sorts of programs
	very convenient with Until. I have not documented the words in
	SEARCH.C yet because I want to use the code some more to be
	sure it 'feels right' in actual use. So, expect the final version
	of SEARCH.C, including documentation, in the next Until release.

	I cleaned up the internal source file handling a little so
	warning messages display when UNTIL.BIN is missing or when
	a non-existent file is specified with fload or include.


V2.0.4  Second public release. It contains a couple of minor bug fixes,
	a new word called UNSEAL, and I re-wrote word() to call
	the C system function strtok() instead of parsing the
	input stream a character at a time. The new word() should
	be faster, although I never got around to doing any timings.

	The port to Unix still has not been done. That should be in
	V2.1. The documentation has had a major overhaul and reflects
	the state of the system. The documentation is a primary reason
	for releasing this version.


V2.0.1	Until for the PC. This is the first publicly available
	version of the "full" Until. As far as I know, there are
	no bugs. Until has been in frequent use writing text file 
	for the past couple of months with only a couple of minor
	problems, which have been fixed. 

	Code is in Until to be compiled on several other platforms.
	Be forewarned that while Until compiles on other systems,
	IT DOES NOT RUN. Porting to other platforms is my next
	priority after finishing the documentation update. An earlier
	version of Until did compile under several operating systems
	so, it should be a matter of simply finding the time.
