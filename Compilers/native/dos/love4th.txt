L.O.V.E. Forth

        Love Forth is a Forth-83 standard programming language for the
IBM PC/XT/AT and compatibles. In order to increase available memory
space over the standard 64k model, it has been designed to operate over
five segments.  These segments are classified by function: machine code,
threaded addresses, data, stacks and dictionary heads. This modification
has been performed without reducing execution speed.

        This version of Forth is shareware - reference LICENSE.DOC for
further information.

        One of the features of this system is it's ability to utilize
third party assemblers - MASM, TASM, A86 or any other you might have -
to process the inline CODE definitions that are then linked into the
program.
