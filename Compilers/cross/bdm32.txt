LMI 80386 UR/FORTH ICD Cable Interface Code

The Motorola CPU32 core ( 6833X) has a Background Debug Mode.
On this mode the CPU communicates thru a serial interface and it is possible
to modify memory and registers.

P&E Microcomputer System TEL (617) 353-9206 sells an  inexpensive interface
to connect the parallel port of a PC to the BDM on the CPU32.

The Software from P&E is a very good developing system for 6833X projects.
I have worked with it for the last 3 years, developing 3 new instruments
(recorders and data acquisition) and the $150 P&E system was the only emulator 
we used.

When the instruments went into production, we had a large amount of problems
with the hardware.

We decided to implement a set of utilities to test the hardware without any 
code running. (BDM requires only the clock and 10 signals)

The first step was to expand the forth system to create a set of operators 
mapping the CPU32 space.

The second was to create a set of script files that when executed by the 
Forth System initialized and tested the instruments.

The Forth used was LMI 80386 UR/FORTH. 
(32bit protected mode running on PharLap TNT Extender)
Since the CPU32 is a 32bit core, using a 32bit Forth seemed like a natural
choice.

It should be possible to port the code to any other 32bit Forth or modified
to run on a 16bit forth.

The files included are:

     BDM32.4TH      interface
     68332.4TH      CPU32 equates
     DUMP.4TH       sample memory dump
     MEMTST.4TH     sample target memory test
