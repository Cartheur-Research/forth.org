The Delta Research people were at the BADGE meeting last night (10/16),
and were demonstrating their "JForth" product.
     
I'm not a "Forth person", so I can't really evaluate their product, but
since there has been some discussion on the availability, etc. of various
Forth's for the Amiga, I thought I'd go ahead and pass this along.
     
The following is extracted from Delta Research's flyer on their JForth
product.  I've edited out most of the superlative adjectives that are
typical in product flyers, and tried to extract the facts (as stated
by Delta).  Please do not consider this to be an endorsement of their
product by me, or my employer.  (Whew!)
     
With that said ...

                      developed for the Amiga
     
     
Completely interactive programming environment.
     
JForth contains both an interpreter and a compiler in one language,
providing an interactive environment.  You may compile programs
directly from the keyboard.
     
Programs are interactively debugged immediately following compilation.
     
Whereas Manx 'C' requires about 3.5 minutes to compile the Sieve of
Erastothenes, JForth completely compiles the standard Forth version
in less than 2 seconds.
     
     
JForth utilizes a technique known as "JSR-Threading" to tie together
compiled programs.  This essentially means that all code produced by
the compiler is directly executable.
     
The following chart compares JForth with 2 other Forth's, one of which
is similarly JSR-Threaded.  The operations are common Forth primatives
used in virtually all Forth programs.  The sieve mentioned is the
"Standard Unmodified" Sieve of Erastothenes benchmark.

I did ask a few of the more obvious questions:
     
Q:  What's the availability of JForth?
A:  We're shipping it this month (October).
     
Q:  Is it copy protected?
A:  No!   [ Much applause from the onlookers! ]
     
Q:  Does it support ALL the Amiga functions?
A:  Yes.  (Everything that's in any Amiga Library.)
     
Q:  Does it work with 1.1 and 1.2?
A:  Yes, it was developed under 1.2.
     
Q:  Does it support extended (Fast) memory?
A:  We're running it with Pacific Cypress's memory board/expansion box
    right now.
     
     
     
My own impressions are that it is indeed a fast programming system, and
the product looked stable.  The person giving the demo had 6 or 7
JForth windows open at once, showing code, debug screens, program
execution that was using graphics calls, etc.
     
Hmmmm ... I've always wanted to learn about Forth ... maybe now is
the time.  (Time ... who has enough of it :-) )
     
Just for the record:  I'm not associated with Delta Research in any
                      way ... just passing along the information.
