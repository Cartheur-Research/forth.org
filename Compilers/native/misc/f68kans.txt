*** latest release *** latest release *** latest release ***

october95:

- significant speedup of control structures, VARIABLEs, CONSTANTs
    and >R R> R@
- added OS9-support provided by Ed Gow
- enhanced Atari loader 
- added a tool for 'revocabularization'. With this tool I remove
    a lot of internal words from the search order, leaving a 
    faster compiling system. Handle with care! 


october94:

- more correctness concerning ANSI: bugs removed
- beta-release of a pure ANSI debugger
- bugs in Atari loader fixed. Now runs fine together with the
    multitasker.
(I have seen a preliminary Mac version running!!) 


august94:

Some minor changes have been made:

- more correctness concerning ANSI: bugs removed
- more completeness concerning ANSI: conditional compilation, 
         SEARCH and SEARCH-EXT, minor stuff
- some non-ANSI extensions: a little multitasker
- some tools from the internet: Anton Ertl's Gray4, source from the news.

Have fun,

- Joerg
