There is not space here to provide an abstract to every book on Forth.
Instead this is a guide to those items which Forth users have found
most helpful, together with a list of other Forth books.  If you have
been especially helped by a book, please write me an abstract for it.

Subject: [2] Books - Tutorial

"Starting FORTH: an introduction to the FORTH language and operating
system for beginners and professionals" Leo Brodie, Prentice Hall 1981
(2nd Ed., 1987), 346 pages, ISBN 0-13-843079-9, price $29.
An ANS version is in preparation.

  Chris Jakeman <cjakeman@bigfoot.com> writes:
  This is the classic introduction to Forth, with helpful cartoons,
  exercises and solutions.  See also Brodie's "Thinking Forth" below.

  Glen Haydon writes "To try out the exercises, use MVP Forth which
  matches exactly except for ' (tick).  See www.theforthsource.com." 
  Forth Guide, from Mountain View Press, is a guide to MVP Forth and
  complements Starting Forth and is available on-line at
  www.theforthsource.com.

  The exercises have also been ported to ANS Forth by Ben Hoyt, see
  ftp.taygeta.com/pub/Forth/Applications/ANS/strtfrth.txt.


"The Forth Programmer's Handbook" E.Conklin & E.Rather, Forth Inc.
1997, 228 pages ISBN 0-9662156-0-5, price $50.

  This book is aimed at experienced programmers new to Forth and is
  more detailed and technical than "Starting Forth".  It is also a
  good reference for ANS Forth.  See www.forth.com for excerpts.


"The Forth Course" Richard Haskell, 156 pages with disk, price $25,
supplier FIG.

  FIG writes:
  This set of 11 lessons is designed to make it easy for you to learn
  Forth.  The material was developed over several years of teaching
  Forth as part of a senior/graduate course in desing of embedded
  software computer systems at Oakland Univeristy in Rochester,
  Michigan.


"FORTH: A Text And Reference" Mahon Kelly and Nick Spies,
Prentice-Hall, 1986, 487pps ISBN 0-13-326331-2 and in hardcover
0-13-326349-5, $19 and $25 from MMS below.

  Dick Miller <MMS@TheMillers.com> writes:
  Very readable, covers beginner level through relatively advanced,
  including Assembler and 8087 math co-processor details, particularly
  appropriate to IBM PC and MMSFORTH, but very strong for general use
  as well.  The only college-level Forth textbook, complete with
  exercises and answers.


"Forth Applications In Engineering And Industry" John Matthews,
Ellis Horwood, 1989 ISBN 0-85312-659-3, price UKP35.
Currently out of print, this book may be available from libraries.

  MPE Ltd. <Sales@mpeltd.demon.co.uk> writes:
  If you are starting out in the field of real-time control of hardware
  using Forth, then this book is for you!  This text covers most
  aspects of real-time control under Forth, from the very basics of
  what Forth is, through to control loops and digital implementations
  of analogue filters.


"Embedded Controller FORTH for the 8051 family" William H. Payne,
Academic Press, 1990, 511 pages with DOS disks, ISBN 0125475705,
price $80 book, $20 disk.

  J. Fulcher, Computing Reviews, 9105-0316 writes:
  ... This hobbyist-style book goes into considerable detail regarding
  the implementation of FORTH on the i8051 family of microcontrollers
  (down to circuit diagrams, PCB layouts, and wire-wrap board
  schematics) ... Almost two-thirds of this book is devoted to
  appendices -- 19 in all.  These primarily contain code listings ... 

  Paul Frenger, SIGFORTH, 2(4):31-32, 1990 reviews the book and gives
  it 10/10.  Notes that the book contains everything you need: all the
  source is there as well as all the circuit diagrams.  There are 19
  appendices, which make up half of the book, and contain things like:
  the source to the 8086 Forth, 8051 Forth, full screen editor code,
  8051 disassembler code, Nautilus metacompiler, 8086/8051
  meta-assemblers, Forth decompilers and much more.


"Forth from Inside" Viviane Beullens, on-line only, 1998, 100 pages, 
contact Viviane.Beullens@ping.be, price $30
  Intended Audience: Beginners in Forth programming
  Reasons to read it: to get started in Forth


  Paul Frenger <pfrenger@ix.netcom.com> writes:
  I just got the Forth Archive CD/ROM from MVP (see section 7) and it's great!
  Glen Haydon also has an excellent collection of Forth books and software,
  much of it seminal (ie: ancient), that FIG no longer carries or never
  carried. His "All About Forth" reference is the single most useful
  Forth-internals book I have ever seen."

  Julian V. Noble, Mechum Banks Publishing, 1992, 300 pages,
  ISBN 0-9632775-0-2, price $50 incl. disk.
 (1st Ed. sold out, FIG still has a few, also Peer-To-Peer
  Communications Inc, San Jose CA at $40 without disk)

  Julian V. Noble <jvn@fermi.clas.Virginia.EDU> writes:
  While not intended for the Forth novice, Scientific FORTH contains a
  good many serious examples of Forth programming style, useful programs,
  as well as innovations intended to simplify number crunching in Forth.
  It can now be found in the libraries of several major universities
  (e.g. Yale, U. of Chicago and Rockefeller U.) and government and
  industrial laboratories (e.g. Fermilab and Motorola).  It comes with a
  disk containing all the programs discussed in the book.


"Thinking FORTH" Leo Brodie, Prentice Hall, 1984, ??? pages,
ISBN: 0-13-917576-8 and 0-13-917568-7 (pbk.), price $20.

  Dick Miller <MMS@TheMillers.com> writes:
  This is a top-notch book on strategy, and always was our [MMS] top
  recommendation for the SECOND book, after you bought a textbook to
  learn the Forth words.  This one teaches you which ones to select
  when, how to hone your habits for better Forth (and other)
  programming, etc.  It's been unavailable for a year or two, and has 
  been reprinted at last!  MMS has worked to reduce its price from a 
  proposed $40 (in paperback), and is pleased to offer it at $19.95.


"Forth: The Next Step" Ron Geere, Addison-Wesley, 1986, 89 pages,
ISBN 0-201-18050-2, price ??.

  Stephen J. Bevan <bevan@cs.man.ac.uk> writes:
  As the title might suggest, this is not for the complete beginner.
  It is aimed at those who have mastered the idea of reverse polish
  ... etc. and now want to do something a bit more complicated.
  Covers areas like: using double length numbers, formatting,
  reading/writing values from/to a port and `infinite' precision
  integers.


"Object-oriented Forth - Implementation of Data Structures" Dick Pountain
Academic Press, 1987, 108 pages, ISBN 0-12-563570-2, price $35.

  Chris Jakeman <cjakeman@bigfoot.com> writes:
  Pountain <diskp@bix.com> is a Byte contributing editor.  His "book
  sets out to develop systematic ways of constructing complex data
  structures in Forth ... with a few easy to use syntax extensions to
  the language."  Efficient techniques for records and arrays are
  presented and refined with great clarity.  Objects are built from
  these by adding methods with a small change to the dictionary
  structure.  The techniques are demonstrated using lists, a heap and
  a dynamic simulation of queuing at the bank.


"Forth: The New Model - A Programmer's Handbook" Jack Woehr,
M&T Publishing, 1992, 315 pages, ISBN: 0-13-036328-6, DOS disk included,
price $45.

  Describes features of ANS Forth and how to use it to write portable
  Forth programs.  Published 2 years before the Standard was approved,
  it predicts the Standard very closely.  Currently the only book about
  ANS Forth.

  Ong Hian Leong <scornd4@solomon.technet.sg> writes:
  The author is (as at time of print) VP of Forth Interest Group and
  member of X3J14, so he presumably knows what he's talking about. 8-)


Threading mechanisms:
  Stephen Pelc <sfp@mpeltd.demon.co.uk> says "The best analysis of the
  tradeoffs of threaded code and memory performance can be found in
  Interpretation and Instruction Path Coprocessing by Eddy H. Debaere
  and Jan M. Van Campenhout, MIT Press, ISBN 0-262-04107-3"

  Mike Coughlin <mikc@gnu.ai.mit.edu> writes: The best article ever
  published on the subject, "Varieties of Threaded Code for Language
  Implementation" by Terry Riter and Gregory Walker, Byte Magazine,
  Sep. 1980 (not in August which was a special Forth issue) and
  reprinted by FIG along with the other Forth articles from Byte.
  Also available on the Byte CD.

"Stack Computers: The New Wave" Phillip Koopman, John Wiley & Sons, 1989,
ISBN 0-470-21467-8, price $82.

  Stephen J. Bevan <bevan@cs.man.ac.uk> writes:
  This isn't a book about Forth, rather it is about computers that
  potentially execute Forth very efficiently.  The book contains a
  detailed overview of a number of Forth chips as well as a potted
  history of what seems to be every stack-based computer ever
  designed.

  Paul Frenger, SIGFORTH, 1(3):28-29, 1989 writes:
  Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone who programs in
  Forth or any other high level language of whatever variety, or who
  is interested in the hardware details of Forth engines or the
  pitfalls of conventional CPU design.

  Stack Computers is in print from Mountain View Press, see
  http;//theforthsource.com

  The author <koopman@cs.cmu.edu> reports (July 96):
  My stack computer architecture book has recently gone out of print,
  but I still receive occasional inquiries as to availability. The
  former publisher, Ellis Horwood Ltd., has graciously returned the
  copyright ownership to me.  So, I have decided to place the book
  on-line at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/index.html

  The book contains, among other things, case studies of seven late-80's
  stack computers.  Perhaps there is renewed relevance with Java (and,
  perhaps not -- that question has already been debated at length).
  The book is still copyrighted, but is readable in its entirety from
  the above URL (see the copyright statement at that URL for details).

  I don't have time, and there doesn't seem to be market demand at this
  point, for a revised edition.  However, if you e-mail me pointers to
  web sites that describe newer stack computer information, I will
  consider putting them in the on-line supplement as time permits.

Subject: [6] Standards Documents

For details of the Forth standards see the FAQ: general - part 1/6.

Published standards since 1978 are Forth 79 and Forth 83 from the Forth
Standards Team, ANS Forth - document X3.215-1994 - by the X3J14
Technical Committee and the Open Boot Standard.

The most recent standard, ANS Forth, defines a set of core words and
some optional extensions and takes care to allow great freedom in how
these words are implemented.  The range of hardware which can support an
ANS Forth Standard System is wider than any previous Forth standard and
probably wider than any programming language standard ever.  The
document includes 90 pages of annexes, providing an insight into the
decisions which had to be taken in drafting ANS Forth.

Copies of the standard cost $193 from the American National Standards
Institute Sales Department (212) 642-4900, but the final draft of ANS
Forth is free and available (subject to copyright restrictions) at:
 ftp://ftp.uu.net/vendor/minerva/x3j14/dpans94.zip (Word For Windows, v2)
 ftp://ftp.uu.net/vendor/minerva/x3j14/dpans94.hqx (Word For Macintosh)
 ftp://taygeta.com/pub/Forth/Literature/dpans94a.zip (plain ASCII)

 ANS Forth was adopted by ISO as an international standard and published
 in June 97 as ISO/IEC 15145:1997


The Open Boot Standard defines the use of Forth to configure the
hardware attached to a computer at startup.  It is a token-threaded,
open standard closely modelled on ANS Forth used by Sun, IBM, Motorola
and Apple.  See also section 6 below:

IEEE Std 1275-1994 is recognised as an American National Standard:
"IEEE Standard for Boot (Initialization Configuration) Firmware:
Core Requirements and Practices, IEE Std 1275-1994, 262p,

  'RISCs Are Faster Than Stack machines', several years ago - you can
  find it on his homepage, http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/. 
  He explains how to write an optimizing Forth compiler that compiles 
  to code approximately as good as a good C compiler generates on the 
  same machine. RAFTS is well and alive (although it currently 
  generates code only for MIPS processors)."


THREADING

  Peter M. Kogge, "An Architectural Trail to Threaded-Code Systems",
  IEEE Computer Journal, Mar 1982, pages 22-32 - Explains the design
  of (a classical implementation of) Forth, starting with threaded
  code, then adding the parameter stack, constants, variables, 
  control structures, dictionary, outer interpreter and compiler."


  SB writes: "A most excellent discussion on all threading varieties
  by Brad Rodriquez is at http://www.zetetics.com/bj/papers/moving1.htm
  Be sure to download the Figures showing code layout for each
  threading method."

  Currently there is no single on-line index to books or published
  papers about Forth.

  FIG supplies a printed index of FORML and euroForml papers.

  http://www.amazon.com and http://www.bookshop.co.uk/SEARCH.HTM find 
  45 books but omit some important ones like Scientific Forth.

  Peter Knaggs maintains a growing on-line database (nearly 600 references)
  to papers from euroFORML, euroForth and Rochester conferences, also
  books and standards.  Use http://dec.bournemouth.ac.uk/forth/search.html
