What's in the files:

stp1.arc:
  "Exact" port of L&P F83 to Atari ST (68000 position-independent code)
Includes the meta-compiler, all source, executable kernel and fully
loaded executable system, plus a brief notes on revision history and how
to run the metacompiler. 

stp2.arc:
   Executable F83 kernel as in stp2.arc plus source for the extensions I
prefer.  Duplicates much of the extension source in stp1.arc but adds a
screen-oriented editor (with documentation) and an eight-blocks-per-page
listing utility. 

stp3.arc:  Miscellaneous utility files
   - useful documentation for the F83 68000 assembler, including a
complete list of valid addressing modes for each instruction. 
   - utility words for accessing GEM's VDI and AES facilities (ST users
will know what that means)
   - complete source code for turning F83 into a GEM desk accessory
(well-behaved but dangerous!), and the executable file
   - buffered GEMDOS file i/o routines (i.e.  getc, putc, loading from
text files, etc.)
   - LDUMP, a variant of DUMP using 32-bit addressing and running in
supervisor mode
   - Quick&Dirty translation of Hawley'se Mandelzen program, producing
garishly-colored Mandelbrot sets (ST 16-color display mode)
