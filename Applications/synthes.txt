                   FORTH programs generation.

  The form of the task of generation has a kind:
  S ( < a condition of a stack before operation > --
      < a condition of a stack after operation > )
     the condition of a stack is in this case set:
  1. Models of data
  2. Models of operations

  The models of data are defined with the help of word COMMENTS{
  on a example: COMMENTS{ a b c }
  a b c - the models data
  The models of operations are defined with
   the help of words (0->1):, (1->1):, (1->2):
  On a example (2->1): +
  + - model of operation of addition

  The installation of the relations between data models is
  defined with the help of analysis FORTH-program.
  The form of the analysis has a kind:
  ANALYSIS{ < FORTH program ( allowed only models of
  operations and s( -- ) design) > }
