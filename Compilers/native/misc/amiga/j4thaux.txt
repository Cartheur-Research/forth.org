       ^^^^^ split for ForthNet port - part a


 Due to lack of traffic and lack of time on my part, I am discontinuing the
 amiga-forth mailing list.  If anyone wants to take up the part of
 administrator, I will be glad to forward them the subscriber list.  Here is
 the last submission I had received.

 Subject: JForth AUX: support (a solution!), CR2LF


 I haven't seen any issues from the mailing list since Volume 2, Issue 6, and
 got to wondering why things are so quiet lately.  Then it occurred to me that
 there probably haven't been any submissions, and I'm as responsible for that
 as anyone.

 It just so happens I have a couple of things I consider worthwhile....

 >Subject:  Using JForth from AUX:

 Since I added the hard disk and extra RAM, my wife has found Word Perfect
 to be pretty easy to use -- which means that I'm starting to get pushed off
 the machine from time to time.  To experiment with AUX: (and to impress
 her) I grabbed one of her old TeleVideo CP/M computers, switched it to dumb
 terminal mode, and hooked it to the serial port.

 Then, I cast about for ways to run JForth from the terminal.  I thought of
 vectoring some of the standard I/O words, then started digging through
 the manual hoping to find an easier way.

 The easier way is called CONSOLE!.  You can open a file or device, and use
 CONSOLE! to send JForth's I/O through that file/device.  It works with AUX:,
 but echoes everything twice.  It works perfectly with SER:, though.

 I call the attached file "aux_support" (even though I'm really using SER:).
 The word "start.aux" saves the pointer to the JForth window, so you can go
 back to it with "end.aux".  I haven't tried typing "bye" from the serial
 port;I assume JForth would close everything OK though (the built-in resource
 tracking makes JForth worth buying all by itself).

 Now, all I need is a text editor.  Anyone have FORTH source to a screen-
 oriented editor (*not* a block editor!) they can email me?

 Oh, the file.  This is all public domain.  I mailed a copy to Phil Burk; I
 hope it gets into the next JGoodies or even included as part of the next
 release.

 >Subject:  cr2lf.f

 I have a rather convoluted way of moving things between Usenet and my Amiga
 (it involves a Mac and MSDOS-format disks).  It saves me a lot of long-
 distance phone calls, but sometimes leaves me with text files that have CRs
 where they should have LFs (dang Mac :-).

 Even if you don't have any use for the main program, you might want to grab
 the "open-input-file" and "close-input-file" words.  The "open..." word uses
 FILEWORD to get a file name.  An "undocumented feature" of WORD and FILEWORD
 (at least the JForth versions) is that if there isn't anything on the line,
 they return a zero-length string.  I test for a zero-length string (dup c@)
 and use the contents of the JForth CONSOLEIN variable if you don't enter a
 file name.

 The "close..." word only closes the file if it isn't equal to CONSOLEIN. If
 you try closing the console twice, you get to see (and curse) that lovely
 "task held" requester.

 I'll send more stuff later.  I'm still piddling with my LKO object library;
 I may just release what I have so y'all can laugh at my code. :-)
