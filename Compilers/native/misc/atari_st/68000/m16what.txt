What's in M16PC.ARC
- wmf 12/11/90

M16PC is a modified version of the Laxen & Perry F83 metacompiler.  It
runs on MS-DOS machines but produces Forth kernels for 68000-based
systems.  The archive includes:

M16PC.COM  -- the executable "cross-metacompiler"

M16PC.BLK  -- source for the metacompiler, to load onto F83
ASM68K.BLK  -- source for the target assembler
EX16PC.BLK   -- some extensions needed by F83

F.COM  -- the specific version of MS-DOS F83 used to make M16PC.COM

MSTP.BLK  -- for testing, source for a 68000 F83 kernel for Atari ST
MSTP.HEX  -- resulting object code (Motorola hex records)
