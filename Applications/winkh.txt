Wink v0.0h  Copyright 1994-7 Leo Wong.  All rights reserved.  The program and source of Wink may be freely distributed.Wink is a DOS word processor for writing.  Wink formats paragraphs but doesn't center, underline, bold, change fonts, etc.Start Wink by entering:  wink [filename]If no filename is entered, Wink asks for one. The default filename extension is .wnk.  If the file exists a backup is made by saving it with the extension .bak (so don't name Wink files that differ only in their extensions).Function keys F1 to F10 allow you to:     F1   find text     F2   repeat find (next)     F3   replace found text (put)     F4   replace after F2 (also)     F5   begin marking if not marking, else unmark     F6   cut marked text     F7   copy marked text     F8   paste cut or copied text     F9   print the entire text or marked text     F10  save and exitCursor, Insert, Delete, etc. keys work as you would expect them to.  There are also a few combined key functions:      Shift-F1   go to DOS.  Type EXIT and press <Enter> to                return to Wink.     Shift-F2   change filename.  If a file of that name                already exists, it is overwritten.     Shift-F3   switch between a 60-character line and a                70-character line for the entire text.  The                default is 60 characters.  Shift-F3 puts you                at the beginning of the text. If you change                linewidth after already creating text, go                over the text to verify spacing.     Shift-F4   turn on/off the display of spaces and                carriage returns.  The default is OFF.     Shift-F8   toggle beween gray-on-blue and black-on-gray      Shift-F9   print in double space     Shift-F10  save what's in memory without exiting     Ctrl-LeftArrow   go to the previous word     Ctrl-RightArrow  go to the next word     Ctrl-Home  go to the beginning of the text     Ctrl-End   go to the end of the text     Ctrl-PageUp    go to the top of the screen     Ctrl-PageDown  go to the bottom of the screen or to the                    last line, whichever is higherWink can hold nearly 64K characters and nearly 3000 lines.  It throws a fit without warning at either limit.Wink uses only standard ASCII characters.  The only control character is CR, which marks the end of a paragraph.  Tab, FF, LF, and EOF aren't used.  If you load a file and it looks cockeyed, Wink is squinting:  press F10 to get out.Wink was written in Frank Sergeant's Pygmy Forth version 1.4 and contains words from L. Greg Lisle's Pygtools.  Sending $15 to each of these two gentlemen will give you Pygmy and Pygtools, possibly lots of fun with Forth, and the ability to change and improve Wink to your heart's desire.     Frank C.
