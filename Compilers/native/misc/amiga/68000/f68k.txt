F68K - a portable Forth system for 680x0 computer



F68K is a native code, portable implementation of Forth. It should run
on every Motorola 680x0 computer without recompiling the binaries.

F68K is connected to the surrounding system via a small loader program,
some kind of a BIOS.

The distribution includes loader programs for Atari ST/TT, Commodore Amiga,
OS9 and Sinclair QL. Only ST/TT is from myself, I have never seen the
others running, so do not blame me for anything.

I am willing to give the best support I can. You can reach me:
