This is Mops 4.0.3, of January 2001.

This is an update and bugfix release, updating 4.0.2.  The details
of the changes are in the release notes.

This package contains the full Mops system.  There is now
only one distribution file, which has the Mops system already 
fully compiled up and ready to run.  This is Mops402.sit.bin.

Earlier Mops releases had both this fully built form and also
a "basic" form which required the full system to be compiled up
from the source files which are included.  However net and
modem speeds are now so fast that the extra download time for
the fully built up version shouldn't bother anybody, and will
prevent possible confusion with having two versions.

The distribution files are in MacBinary format, and are Stuffit
(.sit) archives, which shouldn't present any problems to current
browsers or ftp clients on the Mac, and probably not on Windows
either.

When you expand the file, please read the files "ReadMe.1st" and
"Mops 4.0.3 release notes" first.  They'll tell you what to do next.

The manual is not included in the distribution, since it hasn't
changed from the 4.0 release.  It should be available in
the same location as this distribution, and is in both Microsoft
Word 5.1 and PDF format.  The files are MopsManual400Word.sit.bin
and  MopsManual400PDF.sit.bin.

You will really need the manual if you're going to do anything with 
Mops.



I hope you enjoy it!
