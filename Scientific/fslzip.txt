			** IMPORTANT NOTICE ** 

	FSL.EXE has been deliberately pruned. Its sole purpose 
	is to aid in developing the FSL. Please do not condemn 
	the Forth fsl.exe is derived from on the basis of the 
	pitiful documentation contained in this file!
	The only things that are supposed to work correctly are
	_ALL_ Forth words contained in the ANS documents. Other
	words you might accidently try may or may not work.

Contributers and reviewers in need of 'a second opinion' on FSL code
are invited to use fsl.exe .

FSL.EXE can directly compile any of the FSL algorithm files. A
scientific function plotter (2D and 3D) is built-in. FSL is a
32-bit protected mode Forth. It can use both VCPI and DPMI, so
it is possible to run it directly from DOS or Windows (startup time
under Windows is long, please don't panic and wait patiently).

FSL only runs on INTEL machines and as such won't tell you about alignment
problems. However, you _can_ switch it to case sensitive mode
and turn on the strict ANS flag.


To run fsl.exe:

 set temp=<some path>  ; this the location of an optional swap file
 graphres              ; a TSR needed for VGA 16 color graphics
 fsl <parameters>      ; any Forth statements

Once started, try:  S" r250.frt" INCLUDED
The options are set so that non ANS words are flagged and
the Forth is case sensitive. Use BYE to go back to DOS.
Try EDIT <filename> to edit files. This calls SZ.COM, Tom Zimmers small
Z editor. Try SHOW <filename> to list a file. SHELL goes to DOS, temporarily.
OS <text> lets DOS execute <text>.

Plotting a function:

<left_X_limit> <right_X_limit> SKETCH <function_name>
Here <function_name> should have the following stack diagram: ( F: x -- y )
Example: PI FNEGATE PI SKETCH FSIN .
