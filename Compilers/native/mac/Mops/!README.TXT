This is the Mops manual, as of version 2.6, June 1995.

If you are new to Mops, I recommend you tackle it by reading Roadmap,
and then work through Part I (the Intro and Tutorial).  That will give
you a good start.  Then read as much of Part II as you need or feel
comfortable with.  Use Part III as a reference -- don't try to read it
through.

The Assembler will let you write 68000 machine code, and the Assembler
manual will give you an introduction to 68000 programming.  With the
arrival of Power Macs, however, the Assembler is less useful than it was,
since 68k assembly code will only run under emulation on Power Macs.  So
only bother with the Assembler if you have some very low-level
machine-specific things to do.


Finally, please note that I am releasing all original Mops material into 
the public domain.  If you want to use it commercially, that's fine, go
right ahead, but I'd really appreciate it if you could let me know. In
return I could let you know of any late-breaking bugs/fixes which may be
very helpful to you.  Also, if you want to include Mops in a CD compilation
of shareware/PD material, that's fine, but it would be good if you could
send me a complimentary copy of your CD.

I'd also like to know about any other Mops development that anyone feels 
free to let me know about.  Even better, if you develop some whiz-bang new 
class or whatever, you could send me a copy and I could make it part of the
standard Mops release.  This has already occurred with significant code being
contributed by Doug Hoffman, Greg Haverkamp and Xan Gregg.  As a one-man
part-time effort, Mops can't hope to compete with the slick commercial
products - but with a bit of cooperation from those using it, Mops could
become a very useful development system, and the price is certainly right.
(So is the performance, I think you'll find.)


Internet and Web info for Mops
------------------------------

If you have internet access, you'll find Mops discussion in the group
comp.lang.forth.mac.  Feel free to dive in there.  Also note that I
post a FAQ (frequently asked questions) list there every month or so.
See if you can read the latest version of that before emailing me with
a problem, since a lot of questions people ask me are already answered
there.  But feel free to email me with compliments at any time!!!  :-)

There's a Mops web page at <URL:http://www.netaxs.com/~jayfar/mops.html>.
This has links to the FAQ and the latest Mops version.

For ftp, the latest version should be at:
taygeta.oc.nps.navy.mil, directory  pub/Forth/Mops

Finally, if you do have to email me with a problem, remember to tell me
what version you have!


I hope you enjoy Mops.
