         Release Notes, WinForth Shareware Version 1.01

--------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION

WinForth Shareware Version 1.01 is distributed in the self-extracting
archive file WFSHR101.EXE.

All documentation for WinForth is in the form of on-line
Windows Help files.

To install WinForth Shareware version, create a new directory on your
hard disk, then use CD to select that directory:

   C>C:
   C>MD \WINFORTH
   C>CD \WINFORTH

Copy the WinForth distribution file (WFSHR101.EXE) into the new
directory, then execute the file.  E.g.:

   C>WFSHR101 <Enter>

The file will unpack itself to yield the WinForth executable system, 
utilities, and demonstration programs in the current directory.

Add the statement

  SET WINFORTH=C:\WINFORTH

to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, then restart your system.

Start Windows, go into the Program Manager, and use File-New-Program
to add WinForth to the program group of your choice.  Specify 
C:\WINFORTH as the "current directory" and FORTH.EXE as the program
name.

That's all there is to it!  Read the on-line documentation (reached
via the WinForth "Help" menu) for further information on the use of
WinForth. "Registration" procedures are also explained in the on-line
documentation.

Note: WinForth does not have to be installed in any particular
location or even on drive C:.  The directory does not have to be
named WINFORTH either.  However it is important that the WINFORTH=
environment variable point properly to the actual location of
WinForth.

Updates to WinForth are posted frequently on the LMI BBS
as new features are added and bugs are fixed.
