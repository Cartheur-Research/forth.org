This is the file README and belongs to version 0.9.22 of January, 07 1999
of the C++Builder Win32 port of the portable Forth-environment.

What is it?
===========

PFE is the portable FORTH environment by Dirk Zoller. This contribution contains the
executeable for Windows 95/Windows NT 4.0 and all source files for Borland/Inprise C++Builder 
for recompilation. For installation just extract the executeable PFE.EXE and start it.
PFE does not use any Windows registry entries, so for deinstallation just delete the files.

The original PFE files have version 0.9.14 and can be found under 
http://www.taygeta.com/forthcomp.html

For optimal perfomance (and further documentation) please install the files of 0.9.14 under 
c:\pfe and copy pfe.exe and the changes file of this distribution to c:\pfe. You can overwrite 
the original source files and the changes file. The sources will also (hopefully) compile for 
all the other targets. All changes are documented in the file changes of this contribution. 
The *.pat files in the \src\pat directory show the differences compared to version 0.9.14.
