  1.  Introduction

  This is a brief summary and description of the Forth programming
  language Frequently-Asked Questions (FAQ) files.  They are posted
  monthly to the comp.lang.forth, comp.answers and news.answers USENET
  newsgroups, and are updated (semi)regularly.

  This document is posted to comp.lang.forth every Monday.

  The FAQ is relatively complete and up-to-date, but is not an
  exhaustive treatise on the Forth programming language.  It is meant to
  be a work-in-progress that addresses the many concerns of the Forth
  community, and tries to answer some of the common RFI's (Requests For
  Information) posted to the USENET newsgroup comp.lang.forth.

  If a reader finds any of the information contained in the FAQ
  incomplete, outdated or just plain wrong, they should feel free to
  contact the authors <mailto:faq@forth.org> with a short explanation,
  and perhaps a correction.  Often, when an author is unsure of a piece
  of information they mark it with brackets [like this].  Please see the
  section on ``How to submit changes to the FAQ''.

  If after you've parsed the FAQ for a specific resource you haven't
  found what you want, please feel free to post a clear question to
  comp.lang.forth.  Most netizens will be more than willing to assist
  with your problem.  Please note: Please read the "Flame bait" section
  in part 1 of the FAQ (General/Miscellaneous) before making certain
  assertions, or you may be responsible for starting yet another, same-
  old, "holy war".

  This document is released into the public domain.  You may quote
  freely from it, as long as you play nice and credit the authors.  This
  document is provided for your information only.  Subject to change
  without notice.  Serving suggestion, only.  Trademarks are the
  property of their respective owners.

  May the Forth be with you.

  4.  How to contact the FAQ maintainers

  Each of the documents that make up the FAQ are maintained by different
  authors, and specific queries or complaints should be directed to
  them.  Contact information for each author is found in the preamble to
  each part.  Please see the ``FAQ summary''.

  General comments, updates & questions about the FAQ (or Forth) can be
  directed to the FAQ Maintainers <mailto:faq@forth.org>.

  When in doubt, an email to all the FAQ Maintainers is preferred.

  5.  How to submit changes to the FAQ

  To submit a change to the comp.lang.forth FAQ, send an email to
  faq@forth.org.  The email should have a subject line in the following
  format:

  Subject: Changes to part [1-7] of the c.l.f FAQ

  The body of the email should contain the text you wish to change, with
  the replacement text directly below.  Each of the FAQ documents cover
  a particular subject, so be sure to read that part, first, to find out
  what information is required.  For example, the Systems (Part 4) FAQ
  will require, at the very least, a description of the Forth
  implementation, supported systems, contact information and perhaps a
  URL.

  Once the appropriate FAQ-file has been updated, you should be informed
  that your changes have been incorporated into the FAQ.  Please bear in
  mind that you may not see published results until at least the 4th of
  the month; possibly over a month if the edit was made too late for the
  posting-bot to pick up the latest copy.

  Please note that links, URLs, phone numbers &etc. cannot always be
  verified for accuracy, and once the changes have been incorporated it
  will take another email change request to reverse any changes.

  Finally, one change request per email, please.  This helps keep the
  overhead and confusion down.
