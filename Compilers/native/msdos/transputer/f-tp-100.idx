Description:

Main features:
- Forth 83, with almost all of the ANS Forth core words integrated,
- Trigonometric functions,
- Metacompiler (written in Turbo-Forth, operating from the DOS host as a
  cross-metacompiler); Turbo-Forth is a DOS-file-based 16-bit Forth for
  IBM compatibles developed by Marc Petremann and the French Forth Group 
  in 1989,
- Fully automatic metacompilation, also for generating multisystems,
- Parallel processing similar to the method employed with OCCAM2, 
  adapted to Forth,
- Multisystem option (several transputer Forth systems kept in the same 
  transputer RAM, with access to the respective stacks from any 
  subsystem),
- DOSKEY emulation (FORTHKEY, invoked by hotkeys),
- Collecting characters and character strings from screen via hotkeys,
- Debugger DEBUG (step by step tracing),
- Disassembler DIS (can also be used for disassembling any transputer 
  code fragments residing in transputer RAM such as OCCAM object code),
- Decompiler SEE (with integrated disassembler DIS for code 
  definitions),
- Assembler in postfix notation, fully Forth-like usage, structured (IF-THEN-ELSE 
  etc.),
- Easy calling, from transputer Forth, of any DOS command or programme: 
  DOS [name] ,
- All sources,
- Server from PC DOS host, written in Turbo-Forth,
- Assembling, PEEKing, POKEing, disassembling, DUMPing, also from server 
  (in case the transputer Forth system breaks down),
- Easy interactive menu-driven modification of link adapter port 
  addresses: CONFIG.BAT ,
- Online modification of end-of-system (EOS) address (increasing or 
  decreasing the size of a running transputer Forth system),
- Saving a modified transputer Forth system to the current DOS drive via 
  SAVE-SYSTEM TFORTH.FYS ,
- Saving a modified transputer Forth multisystem to the current DOS 
  drive via SAVE-MULTI TFORTH.FYM ,
- Online help for all vocabularies: HELP
- Rich documentation in various DOC files, a certain number of them in 
  English,
- Saving any transputer Forth RAM area as a DOS file,
- Loading the contents of any DOS file to any transputer Forth RAM area,
- Breaking a transputer Forth programme any time via [ESC], thereby 
  jumping to server in host,
- Resuming such a programme at point of leaving via START ,
- Or else immediately leaving to DOS level by way of BYE-FOR-DOS or 
  [ESC] BYE ,
- Resuming transputer Forth operation from DOS level via TRESUME (DOS 
  batch file), the data stack contents will thereby be preserved,
- New loading of the transputer Forth system via LOAD-FTP , the data 
  stack contents will thereby get lost,
- New loading of a previously saved multisystem via LOAD-FTP M , the 
  data stack contents will get lost,
- DUMPing with screen forward and screen back option on key stroke,
- LEARN [RET] is a setup procedure which binds the online help system 
  ( HELP ) to the respective CONTEXT vocabulary; LEARN comes with some 
  statistics on the words actually documented, the words not found in 
  the documentation file FORTH.VOK, and those words which were defined
  more than once,
- Keyboard buffer extension facility KEYBUF128!
- String input into keyboard buffer (so that parameters to DOS command 
  calls can be easily transferred),
- Loading any transputer Forth programme (source code) via INCLUDE ,
- 25% of the system gets metacompiled, the remaining part will simply be 
  loaded by INCLUDE TCORE [RET] ,
- KERNEL [RET] reduces system to base part of said 25%,
- Easy modification of remaining 75% of transputer Forth system by 
  modifying the source file TCORE.FTH and inputting KERNEL INCLUDE TCORE 
  [RET] ,
- Easy inclusion of non-ASCII characters in the word names by switching 
  from ENGLISH [RET] to GERMAN [RET] and vice versa - to achieve this, 
  the length of a word name, during compilation, will also be placed at 
  the end of the name field,
- TASSEMBLER acts as cross-assembler in host-resident server,
- Assembling and disassembling (e.g. of OCCAM object code) also from 
  server in host,
- DUMPing also from server in host: TDUMP ,
- Access to any editor of one's choice via DOS (e.g. DOS EDIT or DOS 
  EDLIN ...),
- Calling an additional host (Turbo-) Forth system from inside F-TP : 
  DOS FORTH [RET] ,
- Calling e.g. PCTOOLS from inside F-TP : DOS PCTOOLS [RET] , etc.,
- Improved version of LIST also allowing to move back to previous 
  screen,
- Facility of mixing high level and low level words any number of times 
  while compiling a word,
- 32 bit data and return stacks,
- 32 bit addresses,
- 32 bit single precision integers,
- 32 bit single precision floating point numbers, in compliance with the 
  IEEE 754 specifications,
- 64 bit double precision integers,
- 64 bit double precision floating point numbers, in compliance with the 
  IEEE 754 specifications,
- One could even think of using F-TP 1.00 as a "WIN32Forth" system by 
  simply mouse clicking on the appropriate icon on the desktop of either 
  Windows 3.11 or Windows 95. However, there is no use doing so since 
  e.g. the list of words invoked by calling WORDS will creep extremly 
  slowly over the screen as compared with the enormous speed achieved by 
  operating F-TP 1.00 from the DOS level.
