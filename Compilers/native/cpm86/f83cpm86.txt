F83 v2.1.0 Forth compiled for CP/M-86                       15-Dec-2000
-------------------------------------

In 1984, Laxen and Perry released version 2 of their F83 forth compiler.
There were versions for the 8080 (CP/M-80), 68000 (CP/M-68K) and 8086
(MS-DOS and CP/M-86).

While the 8086 version of F83 included an MS-DOS executable, no CP/M-86
executable was provided.  Luckily however, the authors included equates
in the source code to allow recompilation for CP/M-86. 

This archive is intended for CP/M-86 users.  It includes all the source
and readme files from the F83 MS-DOS release and a CP/M-86 executable.


*** THIS IS AN UNMODIFIED VERSION OF F83 2.1.0 FOR CP/M-86 ***



Notes:

1. The following source code locations hold the CP/M-86 / MS-DOS switches:

   KERNEL86.BLK   Screen 1,44,45
   EXTEND86.BLK   Screen 2,9

2. Users with PC's faster than 4.77 MHz should adjust variable FUDGE so
   that MS has the correct delay.  e.g. for 200 MHz Pentium cpu, type:

   5000 FUDGE !  SAVE-SYSTEM F83.CMD

   On fast systems, utilities such as WORDS will execute too fast.  One
   solution is to add a delay after each line output.  To do this, edit
   screen 3 line 4 of UTILITY.BLK as follows, then recompile F83.

      #OUT @ +  RMARGIN @ > IF  50 MS  CR  LMARGIN @ SPACES  THEN ;

3. Not all video functions which use IBM-PC INT 10h will work under
   CP/M-86.  Here are some definitions using CP/M-86 escape codes
   that will replace the existing definitions in F83.CMD

   \ Position cursor
   : AT  ( col row -- )  27 EMIT  ASCII Y EMIT  32 + EMIT  32 + EMIT ;

   \ Clear screen and home cursor
   : DARK  ( -- )  27 EMIT  ASCII E EMIT ;
