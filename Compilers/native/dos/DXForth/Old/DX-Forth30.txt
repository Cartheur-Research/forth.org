DX-Forth 3.0 - Forth compiler for MS-DOS (15-Sep-02)
----------------------------------------------------

DX-Forth 3 is a Forth language compiler/development system for
MS-DOS 2 or compatible disk operating systems.

It is intended to be a complete, easy to use, programming
tool for the creation of MS-DOS applications.

DX-Forth's features include:

 - Forth-94 Standard *
 - Fast direct-threaded code
 - Generate turnkey applications without compiler overhead
 - Floating point and trigonometric functions
 - Many extensions
 - Multitasking
 - Overlays for large applications
 - Forth assembler for CODE words
 - Full source code included

* DX-Forth 3 currently lacks appropriate documentation to
  qualify for Forth-94 compliance.  Some optional wordset
  functions may also be missing.


The archive includes two applications:

HEXBIN - Hex/binary conversion utility
KCS    - Kansas City Standard tape decoder/encoder
