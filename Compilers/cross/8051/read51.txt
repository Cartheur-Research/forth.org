   William H. Payne, the author of "Embedded Controller Forth for the 8051
Family", has generously sent me all the code for the system described in his
book, and has encouraged me to make it available for download.  So, here it
is!  Following this note, there is a more extensive description of what's
in each of the ZIP files, from Jerry Boutelle, which I received from Bill
along with the code.  For the sake of getting started, this brief summary
should be of some help:


  FILENAME       SIZE       BRIEF DESCRIPTION

READ    .ME       6433   This file

PCW2    .EXE    183551   maintain the documen-
PCW3    .EXE    228608   tation files


Notes:

i)    Bill Payne provided me with a few files not present in the book, as
      well as what appear to be newer versions of some of the files con-
      tained in FORTH86.ZIP and FORTH51.ZIP.  I have grouped these together
      in MISCFILE.ZIP.  I'm not sure what all the new stuff is, but Bill
      says the file LSHOW.SCR is a laser printer utility that shows Forth
      screens/documentation in compressed print mode (four pages reduced
      to one).  The file WORDS.DOC is an encyclopedia of all the words in
      the system, I think.  It may be what Jerry Boutelle refers to in his
      note below as "documentation that is not in the book."

ii)   PC-Write is only needed if you plan on modifying the documentation.
      All the documentation is provided both as PC-Write files and as
      plain ASCII files for dumping to a printer.  If you're not going
      to make changes to the documentation, you don't need PC-Write.
      The three files are self-extracting.

iii)  Bill has told me that a company built the machine depicted in his book,
      and it worked the first time out.  He wants people to know that the
      schematics "work", and he cites this as evidence.  The company is:

         Metriguard
         P.O. Box 399
         Pullman, WA 99163
         (509) 332-1600  FAX: (509) 332-0485

      They are selling boards based on the book, the book itself, and the
      code too, the latter for $25.  This may be cheaper than downloading
      for some people.  I do not know if they have all the stuff I do,
      though.

If you have any questions, feel free to call, although you will probably be
better served by either Metriguard or Jerry Boutelle, the signer of the note
below; I'm just a beginner at Forth.

Good luck!

  THE NOTE BELOW CAME WITH THE CODE FROM WILLIAM PAYNE.  READ IT, IT CONTAINS
  IMPORTANT INFORMATION!

Hello,

Well here you go, it is said Forth is an oral tradition and this is very
true. What you have here is not a polished product. You will have to do some
fooling around to figure out what is here.

I have sent you all the files in zip format. I have included the unzip
program if you don't have a copy.

The files on this disk are:

ASCII.SCR       A simple definiton of an ASCII character defining word
ASM86.SCR       The 8086 assembler
BASDIR.SCR      A very simple minded way of looking at directories in Forth
COMPARE.SCR     A utility used to compare two binary images
DEFAULT.SYM     The default symbol table used by the meta-compiler
DOTSTACK.SCR    A stack printing utility
DUMP.SCR        A memory dump utility
FLASH.SCR       A utility used to compare two source screen files
FORTH86.SCR     A the source of Forth that is meta compiled
IMAGE.COM       The output of the meta-compiler. Load every thing here.
IMAGE.SYM       The meta-compiler symbol table after meta-compilation
LAXED.SCR       The source of the editor
MA8086.SCR      The source of the 8086 meta-assembler
MC.SCR          The source of the meta-compiler
MCNOASM.COM     The meta-compiler loaded with no meta-assembler loaded
MC8086.COM      An executable version of the 8086 meta-compiler
NCC2BASE.COM    The extensions required before loading the meta-compiler
NCC2BASE.SCR    The source of the extensions required by the meta-compiler
NDEBUGR.SCR     The source of a forth debugger
PRINT.SCR       The source of a screen printing utility, printer specific
QUAN.SCR        The source of a forth data type used in the meta-compiler
SYSTEM.SCR      The system screen file used by forth
P.COM           The forth system with editor and assembler loaded


The files on the 8051 disk are:

2VF51.SCR       The source of the 8051 prom image
DS4.COM         An executable file for talking with the 8051
DS4.SCR         The source for 8051 communications
MA8051.SCR      The 8051 meta-assembler
DEFAULT.SYM     The default symbol table used by the meta-compiler
SYSTEM.SCR      The system screen file used by forth
MCNOASM.COM     The meta-compiler loaded with no meta-assembler loaded
MC8051.COM      An executable version of the 8051 meta-compiler
IMAGE.COM       The output of the 8051 meta-compiler, ready to prom
IMAGE.SYM       The meta-compiler symbol table after meta-compilation


The documentation disk contains documentation that is not in the book.
It is about the words in the nucleus and the editor. Also there is a little
documentation about the meta-compiler.

It is most important to keep the files from the 8051 disk in a seperate
directory from the files on the forth86 disk!. The meta compiler uses the
same file names but the contents are very different. If the files are mixed-
up in the same directory, bad stuff is sure to result.

The source here differs little from the book. There have been a few bug
fixes here and there.

Bill tells me that the book gives directions about how to use all this stuff
so I will not include that here.

Please feel free to call me if you have any problems, questions or
frustrations.

Cheers,
