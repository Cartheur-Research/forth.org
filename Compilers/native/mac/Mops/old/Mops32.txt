This is Mops 3.2, of July 1998.

This package contains the full Mops system.  There are two
distribution files, which are equivalent, except that one has
the Mops system already fully compiled up and ready to run.
The other only has the 68k nucleus, and you have to go through
a series of steps to compile up the full system from the source
files which are included -- just as you had to do with previous 
Mops releases.

The fully built up version is Mops32built.sea.bin, and is about
2.3 megs.  The "basic" version is Mops32.sea.bin, and is about
1.3 megs.

Previous Mops releases were all in "basic" form.  However net and
modem speeds are now so fast that the extra download time for
the built up version won't bother a lot of people, and will save
them any hassle involved in compiling the system up.

The distribution files are in binary format, which shouldn't present 
any problems to current Mac network software.  They are self-extracting
archives, so on a Mac, just double-click the file and it will expand
itself.  (If you only have a Windows machine, bad luck.)

When you expand the file, please read the files "ReadMe.1st" and
"Mops 3.2 release notes" first.  They'll tell you what to do next.

The manual is not included, but it should be available from the same
location you got this.  It should be called Mops31Wrd.sit or Mops31PDF.sit
(Word or PDF format).  It's a separate file because of size.  It's
still the 3.1 version since the changes since then are fairly minor,
and are all described in the release notes.

You will really need the manual if you're going to do anything with Mops.



I hope you enjoy Mops.
