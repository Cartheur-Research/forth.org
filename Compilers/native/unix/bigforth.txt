This is a small introduction to MINOS preview. It's not intented as
manual, it just helps you to see MINOS work.

MINOS and bigFORTH are copyrighted work, (c) 1997 by Bernd
Paysan. You may copy MINOS as whole, without changes, as it is found
in

http://www.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~paysan/bigforth.zip

Since this is a demo, the right to use and copy this release of MINOS
expires at 1997/9/1. There is no hard enforcement of this expiration,
but an improved version of MINOS will be around then.

MINOS consists of two parts: a widget library (also called MINOS), and
an editor, the tool to master MINOS, called Theseus. To load MINOS,
start "xbigforth" from the bigforth directory, and type in the window:

include minos.str
designer open

This opens Theseus. To arrange objects, MINOS uses a box&glue
model. Start with a box (usually a vertical box, vbox), and add all
the widgets you want there. To navigate within the boxes (one box is
the current box), use the four cursor buttons in the icon bar. The top
five icons select the editing mode: Text, Code, Name, Delete and
Try. The four icons below change the appending order of new objects:
First in the current box, last in the current box, before the current
object, after the current object. The three lower icons allow you to
load, save and execute the current form. Another "designer open" in
the dialog window opens another incarnation of Theseus

MINOS isn't finished, so don't expect everything to work.

To see some of MINOS features, type "include testwidgets.str" in the
dialog window.
