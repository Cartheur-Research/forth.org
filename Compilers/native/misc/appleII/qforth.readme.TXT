QForth 2.1 for the Apple IIe (enhanced), IIc, IIc+, and IIgs.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Original by Toshiyasu Morita, enhancements and bug fixes by
Ronald T. Kneusel, rkneusel@post.its.mcw.edu.


A simple 16-bit integer Forth for ProDOS.  Uses normal ProDOS
text files for source and can create standalone SYS files.

qforth1.shk  -  Application, glossary, and examples.
qforth2.shk  -  Merlin assembler source code.

(ShrinkIt archives each.)


N.B. Nothing is perfect... 

* The first line of a text file is not loaded.  Leave it blank or make it a comment. 

* if .. then  doesn't compile correctly.  Instead, use the less visually appealing 
  if .. else then 

* The QForth kernal is limited to 128 words in the dictionary.  The are presently 127 so double 
  precision arithmetic is going to be added as an extension.

* QForth occupies both hires graphics pages.  A version that preserves hires page 2 is 
  coming shortly.
