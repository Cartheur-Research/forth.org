--- Linux/i386 port of eForth v1.0 ---

This port of eForth v1.0 to Linux is based on the DJGPP/GO32 version
by Andy Valencia (now vandys@cisco.com). Actually, the only modifications
were the conversion of DOS calls (as treated by DJGPP's GO32 DOS extender),
the replacement of .align's that did not work with Linux version of GAS
(which seems to take a 16-bit word size first argument, and fills with NOP's,
whereas vandys' program needed a byte size argument and zero-filling), and
disabling of input echoing and version message (words TAP and 'BOOT).
