URTHD
URTH80      One of these was modified by Larry Mongin of
            Indiana University to download dictionaries
            from CDC's TELEX subsystem; device equates 
            are probably for an Altair 8800; the other
            had minor changes by me to run on an IMSAI
U0418
U0418J      Dictionaries for URTH; don't know what's
            different between the two.
