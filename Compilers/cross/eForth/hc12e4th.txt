Readme file for HC12E4th.ASM

        68HC12 eForth is a direct threaded eforth meant to be assembled
        with the Motorola MCUasm M68HC12 Macro Assembler Version 5.3
        and used on the Motorola M68HC12EVB. The M68HC12EVB used for
        this example of eForth has external RAM installed in sockets
        U4 and U6A. The RAM in these sockets is both byte and word
        addressable. According to the HC12 documentation, there is no
        penalty (in most cases) for byte accesses not aligned on word
        boundaries. However, you will notice the liberal use of the
        directive EVEN and NOPs in the macro expansion.

        Yes, it is true, trying to use a different assembler can provide
        many hours of 'enjoyment' and perhaps some enlightenment. This
        particular MASM had difficulty generating an S record file when
        many ORG directives were used to cause the NAME dictionary to
        separately grow down towards the CODE dictionary growing up.
        Let me know if you find an elegant way to do it.

        Most of the words have been tested. There still may be a bug
        or two in this version of 68HC12 eForth, but it has been working.
        Add interrupts, fuzzy logic and low speed DSP code and the
        learning begins.
