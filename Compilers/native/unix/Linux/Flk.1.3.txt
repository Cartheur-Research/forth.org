Welcome to the FLK forth compiler.

FLK is an optimizing native code compiler targeted for the Intel 386+ CPU
running Linux. Porting to other Intel 386 Unixes should not be hard (
recompile it and go.) I'm curious to hear the results in doing so.

FLK is distributed under the GNU public license. See the file COPYING for the
details.

For a successful compilation you need a running FORTH that is able to execute
a script file. gforth and pfe work fine.

To compile and install the system 
- edit Makefile to match your system (path)
- edit f to match your system
- execute: 
   make install
  or
   make xinstall
  (The latter builds xflk which uses the xforms library. If you don't have it,
   just use "make install".)

See TODO.txt for "construction sites".  I do not plan to continue developing
FLK for a few reasons: 
  - I'm no student anymore. That limits my time more than I like it. ;-) 
  - FLK's optimizer isn't able to do inlining which would gain most speed. 
  - There are some other problems concerning the terminal which are either
    hard to track down or impossible to fix without rewriting the whole
    system.
Instead I want to add my compiler (which I think is very good) to gforth.

A set of HTML files is provided as a basic help in the directory html.
The entry point is the file index.html.

Happy forthing.
